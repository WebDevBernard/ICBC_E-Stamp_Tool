ICBC E-Stamp Tool
-----------------

This executable contains a Python script that scans your Downloads folder for ICBC policy documents
and applies a digital validation stamp.

How it works:
- Checks the 10 most recently modified PDF files in your Downloads folder.
- Stamps any file that resembles an ICBC policy document.

Requirements:
- ICBC policy documents must be saved in your Downloads folder for the script to work.

You can read about the implementation here:
